        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
          mass-market era, our capacity of perceiving and interpreting the world
          and the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream
          about and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and reception
          of art within an environment free of market domination, academic
          technocracy and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          My work as an artist is focused on sound, it's time and experience. I
          intend to create situations where the listener can linger. I believe
          in the contingency of quietened sound to reconstruct the fragmented
          present, to overcome the hurry, the excess of information, the
          automatization, the immediacy of production, consumption and
          optimization. I train myself{' '}
          <em>
            to look better in order to see, to listen better in order to hear
          </em>{' '}
          (Ã‰liane Radigue, "The Mysterious Power of the Infinitesimal"): the
          biggest step of my journey as an artist was to become conscious that I
          am not conscious.
          <br />
          <br />
          I intend to understand and exist in the present through artistic
          creation, focusing on finding a solid ground, presence and intention
          for my creative necessities. Some of my current keywords are
          non-teleology, timelessness, quietness, liminality, contingency,
          silence. Through them, I believe I can find a space of contemplation
          and self-reflection both for me and others.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>
            More and more I have the feeling that we are getting nowhere.
            Slowly, as the talk goes on, we are getting nowhere and that is a
            pleasureâ€¦ Originally, we were nowhere; and now, again, we are having
            the pleasure of being slowly nowhere. If anybody is sleepy, let him
            go to sleep{' '}
          </em>{' '}
          (John Cage, "Lecture on Nothing").
          <br />
          <br />I commit myself to <em>quietening time</em> and{' '}
          <em>lingering over sound</em>.

        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression up to
          this day, our capacity of perceiving and interpreting the world and
          the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about
          and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and reception of
          art within an environment free of economic constraints, academic
          technocracy and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className='italic'>
            Art is a human condition, a condition for being humane, a condition
            for human dignity. I feel the eagerness to exist through artistic
            creation and feeling. I want to express all I can, life, existence,
            the world and its beautiful decrepitude, oozing art every second,
            and whatever escapes from its unconsciousness.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Besides music and sound art, I am exploring visual arts, and
          literature. I am currently expanding my knowledge in philosophy,
          sociology, pedagogy and history of the arts, focusing on posing
          questions such as:
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className='italic'>
            What is happening to art? What is happening to the world? What is
            happening to us? Is art as a condition for human dignity falling
            into disuse?

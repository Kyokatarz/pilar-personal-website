        <Paragraph>
          I would like to question our approach to artistic expression in the
          Neoliberal era, our capacity of perceiving and interpreting the world
          and the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream
          about and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and reception
          of art within an environment free of market domination, academic
          technocracy and administrative deception.
          <br />
          <br />
          My work as an artist is focused on sound and experience. I intend to
          create a series of favorable conditions where the receiver could
          question their perception, sometimes constrained, automatized by the
          hurry, the immediacy of production, consumption, optimization. At the
          same time, I train myself as well{' '}
          <em>
            to look better in order to see, to listen better in order to hear
          </em>{' '}
          (Ã‰liane Radigue, "The Mysterious Power of the Infinitesimal"): the
          biggest step of my journey as an artist was to become conscious that I
          am not conscious.
          <br />
          <br />
          I intend to understand and exist in the present through artistic
          creation, focusing on finding a solid ground, presence and intention
          for my creative necessities. Some of my current keywords are vertical
          time, non-teleology, liminality, silence. I believe I can find a space
          of observation and self-reflection through them both for me and
          others.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>
            More and more I have the feeling that we are getting nowhere.
            Slowly, as the talk goes on, we are getting nowhere and that is a
            pleasureâ€¦ Originally, we were nowhere; and now, again, we are having
            the pleasure of being slowly nowhere. If anybody is sleepy, let him
            go to sleep{' '}
          </em>{' '}
          (John Cage, "Lecture on Nothing").

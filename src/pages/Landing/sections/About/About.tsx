        <Paragraph>
          My name is Pilar Miralles and I was born in Almer√≠a (Spain) in 1997. I
          am a composer, sound artist and writer based in Espoo (Finland). I
          completed my Master's Degree in Electroacoustic Composition in 2020 in
          Madrid (Spain) and my Master of Music in Composition in 2022 at the
          Sibelius Academy of the University of the Arts Helsinki (Finland). My
          current work is focused on the creation of favorable conditions to
          deal through artistic expression with the emotional and social
          constraints imposed by the fast-paced everyday life and immediacy era.
          I am currently aiming for my future doctoral studies in composition.

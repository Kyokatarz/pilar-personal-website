        <Paragraph>
          My name is Pilar Miralles and I was born in Almer√≠a (Spain) in 1997. I
          am a composer and sound artist currently based in Helsinki (Finland).
          I speak Spanish, English and a bit of French. After having graduated
          from the University of the Arts Helsinki, I am focused on expanding my
          personal artistic practice and knowledge, seeking intermedia
          collaborations and embracing a constant attitude of opening,
          perceiving and questioning.

            I would like to question our approach to artistic expression up to
            this day, our capacity of perceiving and interpreting the world and
            the self, and our subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream
            about and work for a new way of creation, interpretation and
            reception of art within an environment free of economic constraints,
            academic technocracy and administrative deception.

              Art is a human condition, a condition for being humane, a
              condition for human dignity. I feel the eagerness to exist through
              artistic creation and feeling. I want to express all I can, life,
              existence, the world and its beautiful decrepitude, oozing art
              every second, and whatever escapes from its unconsciousness.

            Besides music and sound art, I am interested in visual arts,
            contemporary dance and literature. I am currently expanding my
            knowledge in philosophy, sociology, pedagogy and history, focusing
            on posing and answering questions such as

            <span className='italic'>
              What is happening to art? What is happening to the world? What is
              happening to us? Is art as a condition for human dignity falling
              into disuse?

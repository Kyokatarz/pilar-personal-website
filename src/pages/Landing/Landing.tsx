            <br />
            I would like to question our approach to artistic expression up to
            this day, our capacity of perceiving the world and the self, and our
            subsequent consciousness and freedom. I dream about and work for a
            new way of creation, interpretation and reception of art within an
            environment free of economic constrains, academic technocracy and
            administrative deception.
            <br />
            <br />
            Art is a human condition, a condition for being humane, a condition
            for human dignity. I feel the eagerness to exist through artistic
            creation and feeling. I want to express all I can, life, existence,
            the world and its beautiful decrepitude, oozing art every second,
            and whatever escapes from its unconsciousness.
            <br />
            <br />
            Besides music and sound art, I am interested in visual arts,
            contemporary dance and literature. I am currently expanding my
            knowledge in philosophy, sociology, pedagogy and history, focusing
            on artistic expression.
            <br />
            <br />
            What is happening to art? What is happening to the world? What is
            happening to us? Is the art as a condition for human dignity falling
            into disuse?
            <br />

### Roadmap


This application is still under development, but the website is open to public. Meanwhile, we'll keep the content growing and give the app more incentive and innovative designs.

Possible plans in the near future:
- Using CMS (thinking about Contentful)
- Making another webpage, dedicated especially for Pilar's projects. This will be more rounded application with forum where people can hang out and share stuff
